Stopwatch with Dual Mode (Increment and Countdown) Using ATmega32 and Seven-Segment Display, by using ATmega32 microcontroller

Project Overview:

This project involves creating a versatile stopwatch that operates in two distinct modes:

Increment Mode (Default): The stopwatch counts upwards from zero, displaying hours, minutes, and seconds on six seven-segment displays.

Countdown Mode: The stopwatch counts downwards from a user-defined time, functioning as a countdown timer.

Features:

• Reset Function: Resets the time to zero in both modes.

• Pause Function: Pauses the time counting, allowing the stopwatch to hold its current value.

• Resume Function: Resumes counting from the paused time.

• Mode Toggle: Switches between increment and countdown modes.
